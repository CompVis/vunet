# A Variational U-Net for Conditional Appearance and Shape Generation

This repository contains training code for the CVPR 2018 spotlight

[**A Variational U-Net for Conditional Appearance and Shape Generation**](https://compvis.github.io/vunet/images/vunet.pdf)

The model learns to infer appearance from a single image and can synthesize
images with that appearance in different poses.

## Notes

This is a slightly modified version of the code that was used to produce the
results in the paper. The original code was cleaned up, the data dependent
weight initialization was made compatible with `tensorflow >= 1.3.0` and a
unified model between the datasets is used. You can find [the original code and
checkpoints online (`vunet/runs`)](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/71842715a8/) but if you want to use
them, please keep in mind that:

- the original checkpoints are not compatible with the graphs defined in this
  repository. You must use the original code distributed with the checkpoints.
- the original code uses a data dependent weight initialization scheme which
  does not work with `tensorflow >= 1.3.0`. You should use `tensorflow==1.2.1`.
- the original code became a bit of a mess and we can no longer provide support for
  it.

## Requirements

The code was developed with Python 3. Dependencies can be installed with

    pip install -r requirements.txt

These requirements correspond to the dependency versions used to generate the
pretrained models but other versions might work as well.

## Training

[Download](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/71842715a8/) and unpack the desired dataset.
This results in a folder containing an `index.p` file. Either add a symbolic
link named `data` pointing to the download directory or adjust the path to
the `index.p` file in the `<dataset>.yaml` config file.

For convenience, you can also run

    ./download_data.sh <dataset> <store_dir>

which will perform the above steps automatically. `<dataset>` can be one of
`coco`, `deepfashion` or `market`. To train the model, run

    python main.py --config <dataset>.yaml

By default, images and checkpoints are saved to `log/<current date>`. To
change the log directory and other options, see

    python main.py -h

and the corresponding configuration file. To obtain images of optimal
quality it is recommended to train for a second round with a loss based on
Gram matrices. To do so run

    python main.py --config <dataset>_retrain.yaml --retrain --checkpoint <path to checkpoint of first round>


## Pretrained models

You can find [pretrained models
online (`vunet/pretrained_checkpoints`)](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/71842715a8/).


## Other Datasets

To be able to train the model on your own dataset you must provide a pickled
dictionary with the following keys:

- `joint_order`: list indicating the order of joints. 
- `imgs`: list of paths to images (relative to pickle file).
- `train`: list of booleans indicating if this image belongs to training split
- `joints`: list of `[0,1]` normalized xy joint coordinates of shape `(len(joint_jorder), 2)`. Use negative values for occluded joints.

`joint_order` should contain

    'rankle', 'rknee', 'rhip', 'rshoulder', 'relbow', 'rwrist', 'reye', 'lankle', 'lknee', 'lhip', 'lshoulder', 'lelbow', 'lwrist', 'leye', 'cnose'

and images without valid values for `rhip, rshoulder, lhip, lshoulder` are
ignored.
